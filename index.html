            hundreds of labor hours, and I worked directly with the company's CTO, who commended me for my work. Over the duration of this internship, I learned about Microservices, Modern API Development
            (with GraphQL and Apollo), and React.js.</h3>

            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">I was elected to lead over 1500 fellow highschoolers throughout the Mid-Atlantic State(NJ, PA, NC, MD, VA, DE). My role was to perfect the Mid-Atlantic State by utilizing technology and legislation to solve its issues. In my position, I not only created the aforementioned State Assembly site, but also came up with reforms
            (such as hosting meetings online) that brought legislation and engagement to their highest points in 30 years.</h3>

            <h3 class = "tiny"><a class = "tinyStyledLink" target="_blank" href = "https://juniorcodingleague.org">Junior Coding League</a> (Jul 2019 - Apr 2021)</h3>
            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">In an attempt to teach students programming in a new and unique manner, I founded Junior Coding League. The organization is built around the idea that students should
            learn to code based off of projects they build, not just by memorizing syntax. In our classes, students learn how to code by building games they've played their whole life (Flappy Bird, Cookie Clicker, etc.),
            ensuring they have fun as they code and test their projects. Our idea proved wildly successful, and we currently are a registered nonprofit, have 500+ students, and are expanding into India, Afghanistan, and Nigeria!</h3>

            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">I've always gravitated to technology, and that's why I joined and rose through the ranks of the WWP Technology Student Association chapter.
            As President, I not only brought the club's membership to its highest point ever, but I also implemented a website which students could use in order to grow their technological skills.
            The website was inspired by the CTFs I competed in, and enabled students to submit answers to weekly challenges, ensuring they would learn something new each week, even if they couldn't attend the club meeting.</h3>

            and data structures. I rose all the way to the Gold rank, one of only 612 students nationwide to achieve this prestigious rank.</h3>

            binary exploitation (buffer overflow), cryptography (RSA encryption, hash collision, etc), and forensics (file recovery, password cracking, etc). I've placed 5th in PeaCTF(out of 1600), 8th in AngstromCTF(out of 1500), and 37th
            in PicoCTF (out of 10000)</h3>
