            oftentimes, it can be hard to find the cheapest price of a given product, especially considering the thousands of e-commerce sites out there.
            PriceMerge solves this issue by comparing product prices across thousands of websites and automatically showing the cheapest price. It also provides price drop alerts.</h3>

            MediVision thus enables doctors to forecast drug prices using a linear regression SkLearn model, ensuring that the prescribed drug is the best for the patient in the long run.</h3>

            The system enabled them to manage employee recruiting, send out acceptance/rejection emails, and ensure that only HR staff had access to sensitive data. My platform helped the company save
            hundreds of labor hours, and I worked directly with the company's CTO, who commended me for my work. Over the duration of this internship, I learned about Microservices, Modern API Development

            can actually modify how JSA functions through legislation, and my job was to oversee this legislation. In my position, I not only created the aforementioned State Assembly site, but also came up with reforms

            <h3 class = "tiny"><a class = "tinyStyledLink" target="_blank" href = "https://juniorcodingleague.org">Junior Coding League</a> (Jul 2019 - Apr 2021)</h3>
            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">In an attempt to teach students programming in a new and unique manner, I founded Junior Coding League. The organization is built around the idea that students should
            learn to code based off of projects they build, not just by memorizing syntax. In our classes, students learn how to code by building games they've played their whole life (Flappy Bird, Cookie Clicker, etc.),
            ensuring they have fun as they code and test their projects. Our idea proved wildly successful, and we currently are a registered nonprofit, have 500+ students, and are expanding into India, Afghanistan, and Nigeria!</h3>

            <h3>WW-P North Chapter President</h3>
            <h3 class = "tiny"><a class = "tinyStyledLink" target="_blank" href = "https://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Assocation</a> (2019 - 2021)</h3>
            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">I've always gravitated to technology, and that's why I joined and rose through the ranks of the WWP Technology Student Association chapter.
            As President, I not only brought the club's membership to its highest point ever, but I also implemented a website which students could use in order to grow their technological skills.
            The website was inspired by the CTFs I competed in, and enabled students to submit answers to weekly challenges, ensuring they would learn something new each week, even if they couldn't attend the club meeting.</h3>

            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">The USA Computing Olympiad tests the programming abilities of hundreds of thousands of students nationwide, and as a competitor I was able to grow my knowledge of algorithms
            and data structures. I rose all the way to the Gold rank, one of only 612 students nationwide to achieve this prestigious rank.</h3>

            <h3>CyberSecurity CTF Competitor</h3>
            <h3 class = "tiny" style = "color: black;">In addition to Hackathons, I also compete in CyberSecurity CTF competitions. I've learned a lot about vulnerabilities in websites (such as SQL Injections, XSS attacks, and SSTI) as well as
            binary exploitation (buffer overflow), cryptography (RSA encryption, hash collision, etc), and forensics (file recovery, password cracking, etc). I've placed 5th in PeaCTF(out of 1600), 8th in AngstromCTF(out of 1500), and 37th
            in PicoCTF (out of 10000)</h3>
